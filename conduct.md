Project Jupyter is an engaged and respectful community made up of people from
all over the world. Your involvement helps us to further our mission and
create an open platform that serves a broad range of communities, from
research and education to journalism, industry and beyond.

At Project Jupyter and JupyterDay, we are committed to providing a
harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or
religion. Conference organizers will not tolerate harassment of participants
in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any part of
the conference venue, including talks.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave
professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or
exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for Project Jupyter events.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference without
a refund at the sole discretion of the conference organizers.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Offensive verbal comments related to race, ethnicity, culture, national
  origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational
  level, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and expression, age,
  physical appearance, family status, religion, and mental
  and physical disability.
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

By following the guidelines above and consistently and fairly resolving
any complaints we can make attending JupyterDay a welcoming event.

## Enforcement

* Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
  immediately.
* If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers retain
  the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment
  for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion
  from the conference with no refund.
* Event organizers may take action to remedy or set right anything designed
  to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the
  environment hostile for any participants.

unwelcome, please report this as soon as possible. Code of conduct
violations reduce the value of our event for everyone and we take them seriously.
