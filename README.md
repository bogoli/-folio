## Features

### Collections
This Jekyll theme implements collections to let you break up your work into categories. The example is divided into 	*poetry* and *portfolio*, but easily revamp this into *recipes*, *apps*, *short stories*, *limericks*, whatever your creative work is. 

To do this, edit the `collections` in the `_config.yml` file, create a corresponding folder, and update the `portfolio` and `poetry` source files. 

### Layouts
Three different layouts are included:
* `poetry`: a simple list of entries
* `blog` layout (index.html): more detailed descriptive list of entries
* `portfolio` layout: overlays a descriptive hoverover on a background image. If no image is provided, the square is auto-filled with the chosen theme color. Thumbnail sizing is not necessary, as the grid crops images perfectly. 

### Portfolio Specifics
You can easily add full pages for each of the projects in your portfolio. If you want one to link to an external website, create a file for it in _portfolio, and  fil in the YAML front matter as you would for another, but with a redirect, like so: 

	---
	layout: post
	title: Project
	description: a project that redirects to another website
	img:
	redirect: https://otherpage.com
	--- 

### Theming
Six beautiful theme colors have been selected to choose from. The default is red, but quickly change it by editing the `_base.scss` file in line 40. The color variable are listed there, as well. 

### Photos
Photo formatting is made simple using rows of a 3-column system. Make photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width. Easily create beautiful grids within your blog posts and projects pages. 

### Code Highlighting
This theme implements Jekyll's built in code syntax highlighting with Pygments. Just use a liquid tag to delineate your code: 
```
{% highlight python %}
	code code code
{% endhighlight %}
```

### Config
This theme has a number of basic config options:
* `baseurl` - set this if your site is not at your server's root url.
* `email`, `twitter_username`, `github_username` - update to your own.
* `title`, `description` - update for site-wide title and description.
