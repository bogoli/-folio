I"<p>Call the roller of big cigars,  <br />
The muscular one, and bid him whip  <br />
In kitchen cups concupiscent curds.  <br />
Let the wenches dawdle in such dress  <br />
As they are used to wear, and let the boys  <br />
Bring flowers in last monthâ€™s newspapers.  <br />
Let be be finale of seem.  <br />
The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream.</p>

<p>Take from the dresser of deal.  <br />
Lacking the three glass knobs, that sheet  <br />
On which she embroidered fantails once  <br />
And spread it so as to cover her face.  <br />
If her horny feet protrude, they come  <br />
To show how cold she is, and dumb.  <br />
Let the lamp affix its beam.  <br />
The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream.</p>
