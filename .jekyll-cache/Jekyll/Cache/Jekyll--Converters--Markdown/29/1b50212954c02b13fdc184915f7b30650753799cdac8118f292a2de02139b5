I"j<p>I?  <br />
I walk alone;  <br />
The midnight street  <br />
Spins itself from under my feet;  <br />
When my eyes shut  <br />
These dreaming houses all snuff out;  <br />
Through a whim of mine  <br />
Over gables the moon’s celestial onion  <br />
Hangs high.</p>

<p>I  <br />
Make houses shrink  <br />
And trees diminish  <br />
By going far; my look’s leash  <br />
Dangles the puppet-people  <br />
Who, unaware how they dwindle,  <br />
Laugh, kiss, get drunk,  <br />
Nor guess that if I choose to blink  <br />
They die.</p>

<p>I  <br />
When in good humor,  <br />
Give grass its green  <br />
Blazon sky blue, and endow the sun  <br />
With gold;  <br />
Yet, in my wintriest moods, I hold  <br />
Absolute power  <br />
To boycott any color and forbid any flower  <br />
To be.</p>

<p>I  <br />
Know you appear  <br />
Vivid at my side,  <br />
Denying you sprang out of my head,  <br />
Claiming you feel  <br />
Love fiery enough to prove flesh real,  <br />
Though it’s quite clear  <br />
All you beauty, all your wit, is a gift, my dear,  <br />
From me.</p>
